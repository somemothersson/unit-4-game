            <p>Things just always seem to work out in the end for Jerry Seinfeld. He loses $50 in a card game, and the next day
                he finds a $50. Hence, Elaine dubbed him "Even Steven" in episode 86, "The Opposite."</p>
            
            <p>The goal of this game is for Jerry to retain his status of Even Steven. You will be given a <span class = "bold">"Random Number to Hit." </span>
            Click the <span class = "bold">Jerry Buttons</span> to increase your <span class = "bold">Counter</span> until the point that you can <span class = "bold">EVENLY match the Random Number</span>. </p>
            <p>Each time you can match up with the Random Number, you will Win! But beware, if you go over the Random number. You will not only
            damage Jerry's fragile ego, you will also lose!</p>

            <p>Good Luck!</p>
