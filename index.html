            <p>Things just always seem to work out in the end for Jerry Seinfeld. He loses $50 in a card game, and the next day
                he finds a $50. Hence, Elaine dubbed him "Even Steven" in episode 86, "The Opposite."</p>
            
            <p>The goal of this game is for Jerry to retain his status of Even Steven. You will be given a random Number. 
            Use the Jerry buttons to increase your counter until the point that you can EVENLY match the random number. Each time
            you can match up with the Random Number, you will Win! But beware, if you go over the Random number. You will not only
            damage Jerry's fragile ego, but you will also lose.

            Good Luck!
