### Overview

In this assignment, I had to create an interactive game for web browsers. The app is required to  dynamically update the HTML pages with the jQuery library.


### Game Functionality


1. There are four george buttons displayed the page.
  * Each time one of these buttons is clicked the counter will increase and be diplayed via jQuery
  * If the counter number = the random number - the player will win and the game will reset the random number   and the values of the tiles

2. When the game begins
  * a random number between 19 - 120 will be generated and displayed to the 


3. When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 
      * 
      * 
     * Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
     * When they do click one, update the player's score counter.

   * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

   * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

   * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

     * When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

   * The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
