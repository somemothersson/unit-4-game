### Overview

In this assignment, I had to create an interactive game for web browsers. The app is required to  dynamically update the HTML pages with the jQuery library.


### Game Functionality


1. There are four `Jerry buttons` displayed the page.
    * Each time one of these buttons is clicked the counter will increase and be diplayed via jQuery
    * If the counter number = the random number - the player will win and the game will reset the random number   and the values of the tiles

2. When the game begins
    * a random number between `19 - 120` will be generated and displayed to the `Your Number to Hit:` field


3. When the player clicks on a `Jerry`, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 
    * The player will not know the amount until the player clicks a crystal.
    * When they do `click` one, it will update the player's score `counter`.
    * The player wins if their total score matches the `random number` from the beginning of the game.

4. The player loses if their score goes above the `random number`.

5. The game restarts whenever the player `wins or loses`.

6. When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the `Jerry's` will have `four new hidden values`. Of         course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero. 

7. The app shows the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
